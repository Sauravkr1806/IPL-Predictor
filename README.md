# Introduction
IPL match analysis using that data from all the IPL matches from the beginning till date. Our main motive is to predict the batting team probability and the losing team probability based on score and the match situation.

# Dataset

# ShowCase

# Usage
To make predictions, provide the following parameters when prompted:

- **Batting Team**: The team currently at bat.
- **Bowling Team**: The team currently bowling.
- **City**: The location of the match.
- **Current runs**: The current score of batting team.
- **Overs Completed**: The number of overs completed.
- **Wickets**: The number of wickets lost.
- **Target Runs**: The total runs scored by a bowling team.

The predictor will calculate the probability of the batting team winning and bowling team winning based on these parameters and the current match situation.
